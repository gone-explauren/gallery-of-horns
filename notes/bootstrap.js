// React Bootstrap: a library of pre-built components to bring into and integrate with your project

// Bootstrap is not installed globally, must be installed each project
// If it's installed on a branch, it will be icluded in the merge when you pull from main

// To install, run this in the terminal for your project: npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

// Import components (ie buttons, alerts), browser globals, and CSS from : <https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction>
// The Bootstrap CSS I imported to Main.js: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

// Be careful to note that some code aqvailbale to copy/paste on the React-Bootcamp site includes functional components instead of class components
